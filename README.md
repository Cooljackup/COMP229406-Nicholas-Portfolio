## React + Vite

This repository provides a simple website that utilizes React and Vite together with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, it only offers 5 different pages:

- ***Home:*** The main page for the website. Includes a navigation bar to switch between the different available pages.
- ***About Me:*** This page includes a picuture, a short introduction of myself, and includes a downloadable version of my resume.
- ***Projects:*** A page that list of my most 3 recent worked on/contributed to projects. All include a picture, a short description, and a link to the source code.
- ***Services:*** A page that lists all of the services and technical skills I know and able to do. Each skill includes a photo as well.
- ***Contact Me:*** A page to allow the user to be able to send me a message. (Currently does not send me a message, however it does capture the information and save it.)
